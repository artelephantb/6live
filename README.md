# 6live
*A game of teamwork and betrayal*
## How to play
The game starts as soon as the *datapack* activates.
The game gives players 10 minutes to setup, and get ready. The game is in mid-night.
When the game starts, each player gets 6 lives. If a player is on 2 lives, they can **kill** another player to gain a life, and if a player on 1 life left kills, they don't get punished. If a player with more lives **kills**, they also die. After all lives are out for a player, they are out of the game.
